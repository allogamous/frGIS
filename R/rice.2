#' Multi-environment Upland rice data set with phenotypic data and geographic covariates.
#'
#' A data set of upland rice genotypes containing 19 elite-lines and 4 cultivars (total of 23 genotypes)
#' were evaluated in the crop season of 2012 and 2013 at 14 locations. Each trial was analyzed in
#' randomized complete block design, with four replications, and based on plot consisted of five rows
#' of 5,0 m spaced at 0.3 m, with seeding density of 60 seeds.m-1.
#' Crop management and sowing dates were performed according to the current farmer management at
#' region where each trial was conducted. This experimental design and trial management are standardized
#' for cultivar testing trials in upland rice breeding program of Embrapa.
