# Basic usage

FRgis is a useful package for breeders and statisticians interested in guiding diagnostic recommendations for new cultivars and evaluating the phenotypic plasticity of germplasm against spatial variations in a given region. This package can also be used to support the targeting of products in pre-commercial material evaluation phases, guiding the allocation of effort and resources to priority target regions.
